	<P>C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language that provides low-level access to system memory. It's known for being efficient, portable, and flexible, and is used in a wide range of applications. C was invented in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at AT&T (then called Bell Laboratory) as a successor to the B programming language. It was designed to overcome the problems encountered by BASIC, B, and BPCL programming languages.
